# ArchLinux_Setup
A informal guide/documentation of how to install and quickly customize your setup.

check my [Wiki](https://github.com/Aykarus/ArchLinux_Setup/wiki) page for install guide.

## Alternatives
Personally I am currently using Manjaro i3 which is another distro based on arch linux. The difference is that it is a lot easier to install and will come with some preinstalled packages that will depend on which version of Manjaro you decide to download. Which can be a pro or a con for some people.

[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)

Packages I will be using:
- i3-gaps
- i3Status
- [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)
- [pyWal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
